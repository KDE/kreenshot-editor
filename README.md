Debug with: $ kreenshot-editor ~/Pictures/screenshots/2014-05-04_Screenshot-1.png

TODO
----
- NEXT: genincludes --> cmake
- NEXT: save basic settings like default image output location
    goal: to set some debug folder without messing in the code itself
    --> QSettings
  - use m4 to generate settings class

- save image to file: do not save selection indication rect
- save settings to file
- enable more item properties (see item.h/cpp)
- enable hover visual
- makes sure line has a bigger catch area when trying to move
- ToolManager: Draw item tool: text, highlight, obfuscate
- key movement of items

- crop etc. tool
- rename Item to KreenItem
- add context menu to select tools
- add handles for rect resizing and line repositioning (as extra class)
    - Ctrl for propertional
- Draw rect tool
- draw arrow
- click on empty space chooses Select tool
- The QGraphicsProxyWidget class provides a proxy layer for embedding a QWidget in a QGraphicsScene

LATER
-----
- OpenSuseBuild service
- Select a Item
  - Handles for resizing appear
  - Controls for common properties appear
     - most recently used or pinned colors
     - slider for line width
     - slider for font size
     - slider for arrow tip typ?
- AFTER UndoManager is complete:
    - write filename in title and full path in status bar (<path> [change...])
        let appear in windows title and in filename --> statusbar / ...edit pattern...
        [NEW] ...
        *  ... (see mainwindow.cpp)
- Create Actions in lib and use in GUI
- "Open last file storage location" or "Open storage location"

QUESTIONS
---------
- where to store data files like default background image?
- nullable QPoint for function parameter?
- is QImage reference counted?
- statt QScrollView kann man auch bei QGraphicsScene.setSceneRect verwenden. Was ist besser?
