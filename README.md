kreenshot-editor
================

kreenshot-editor is incubating.

More documentation can be found in doc/DOC.md.

Quick Build
-----------
# EITHER: for development (Debug, local install prefix):
$ mkdir build; cd build; cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/../usr ..

# OR: default (DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX defaults to /usr/local):
$ mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..

# THEN:
$ make

Run
---
in build directory:
$ ./src/kreenshot-editor

via helper script to test local installation:
$ ./doc/kreenshot-editor-local-debug.sh

KNOWN BUGS
----------
- Resize the main window requires the user to click the editor widget to restore the cursor to normal.
  => No mouse events are handled until mouse click.
  Happens since the beginning of the project
- see TODO.txt

QUESTIONS
---------
- search for "WORKAROUND"
- how to provide own icons?
- how to install the lib and the app?
    - how to put the include files for dev in the right place?
- where to store data files like default background image?
- nullable QPoint for function parameter? --> just use a shared_ptr???
- statt QScrollView kann man auch bei QGraphicsScene.setSceneRect verwenden. Was ist besser?
- prepare-include-files.sh: does it makes sense to distinguish between KREEN_CORE_EXPORT and KREEN_UI_EXPORT???
- restrict drawing outside scene rect; clip, clipping (currently solved with workaround)

DEVELOPMENT
-----------
Debug with: $ kreenshot-editor ~/Pictures/screenshots/2014-05-04_Screenshot-1.png

Create new header guard UUI:
$ python -c 'import uuid; print("UUID_" + str(uuid.uuid1()).replace("-", ""))'

Example to run a install prefixed build:
    #!/bin/bash
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/dev/src/kreenshot-editor/build-release/install/usr/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ~/dev/src/kreenshot-editor/build-release/install/usr/bin/kreenshot-editor $@
