- The QGraphicsProxyWidget class provides a proxy layer for embedding a QWidget in a QGraphicsScene

LATER
-----
- cmake for testdata: file(COPY yourDir DESTINATION yourDestination)
- PageOutput Settings: file format combobox should use setModel(), QAbstractItemModel,
    be an own widget and show also description
- OpenSuseBuild service
    - pak: run unit tests after build
- Ctrl+Shift+C: copy image to clipboard
    - show message flash, when done (or KMessageBox, "show never again")
    - plus: provide drag source for DND
- Open last save location
- // TODO: use QProcess to lookup if dolphin exists and use it, else use the existing method
    - dolphin --select
- lib: provide different kinds of mainwidget
   - with or without toolbar
   - with some predefined stuff etc.
- Select a Item
  - Controls for common properties appear
     - most recently used or pinned colors
     - slider for line width
     - slider for font size
     - slider for arrow tip typ?
- AFTER UndoManager is complete:
    - write filename in title and full path in status bar (<path> [change...])
        let appear in windows title and in filename --> statusbar / ...edit pattern...
        [NEW] ...
        *  ... (see mainwindow.cpp)
- "Open last file storage location" or "Open storage location"
- ? click on empty space should choose Select tool
- ? use m4 to generate settings class
- ? use #pragma once? (non-standard) / replace it as soon as someone sees a problem

BUGS
----
- BUG: resize the main window requires the user to click the editor widget to restore the cursor to normal
    nothing goes until it was clicked
- item->lineStyle()->width = 3; // TODO: if this number is uneven, then the item AND the black selection handles become blurred!

QUESTIONS
---------
- how to provide own icons?
- how to install the lib and the app?
    - how to put the include files for dev in the right place?
- where to store data files like default background image?
- nullable QPoint for function parameter? --> just use a shared_ptr???
- statt QScrollView kann man auch bei QGraphicsScene.setSceneRect verwenden. Was ist besser?
- prepare-include-files.sh: does it makes sense to distinguish between KREEN_CORE_EXPORT and KREEN_UI_EXPORT???
