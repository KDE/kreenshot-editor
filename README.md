- The QGraphicsProxyWidget class provides a proxy layer for embedding a QWidget in a QGraphicsScene

LATER
-----
- cmake for testdata: file(COPY yourDir DESTINATION yourDestination)
- PageOutput Settings: file format combobox should use setModel(), QAbstractItemModel,
    be an own widget and show also description
- pak: run unit tests after build
- prepare-include-files.sh: only find classes with the KREEN_*(?)EXPORT macro
    - does it makes sense to distinguish between KREEN_CORE_EXPORT and KREEN_UI_EXPORT???
- OpenSuseBuild service
- Ctrl+Shift+C: copy image to clipboard
    - show message flash, when done (or KMessageBox, "show never again")
    - plus: provide drag source for DND
- Open last save location
- // TODO: use QProcess to lookup if dolphin exists and use it, else use the existing method
    - dolphin --select
- Settings: After saving: copy image path to clipboard
- Select a Item
  - Handles for resizing appear
  - Controls for common properties appear
     - most recently used or pinned colors
     - slider for line width
     - slider for font size
     - slider for arrow tip typ?
- AFTER UndoManager is complete:
    - write filename in title and full path in status bar (<path> [change...])
        let appear in windows title and in filename --> statusbar / ...edit pattern...
        [NEW] ...
        *  ... (see mainwindow.cpp)
- Create Actions in lib (instead of UI file) and use in GUI (Ã¼berlegen: nice ui file vs. good coding)
- "Open last file storage location" or "Open storage location"
- use m4 to generate settings class
- use #pragma once? (non-standard) / replace it as soon as someone sees a problem

QUESTIONS
---------
- how to install the lib and the app?
    - how to put the include files for dev in the right place?
- where to store data files like default background image?
- nullable QPoint for function parameter? --> just use a shared_ptr???
- statt QScrollView kann man auch bei QGraphicsScene.setSceneRect verwenden. Was ist besser?
