TODO
----
- see /home/gregor/kdesrc/kde/kdegraphics/kolourpaint/cursors/
- enable more item properties (see item.h/cpp)
- key movement of items
- Home, End, PageUp, PageDown: item stacking
    - remove from toolbar
    - obfuscate should be always at bottom
    - todo: later: when multiple items are selected and lowered, the lowering never stops because items get swaped
    - Factor out Editing actions into separate class?
    // TODO: are all selected items raisable? Move all this to new class EditingMgr
    // TODO: are all selected items lowerable?
    - icons
- add context menu to select tools
- draw arrow (use QPainterPath from TikzKit)
- The QGraphicsProxyWidget class provides a proxy layer for embedding a QWidget in a QGraphicsScene
- move crop tool: should respect image boundaries!!!
- undo should restore selection

IDEAS
-----
- In toolbar: combobox for applying preset properties (content depends on current tool)
    - "image object" is also a tool (todo)
        - insert from file
        - insert from clipboard
    - same props => same preset name? --> yes, but per tool
- Arrow/line, 4 buttons in props toolbar for arrow top: none, start, end, both
- Replacement for Imageviewer:
    Select no tool: zoom to fit. Any tool or Select: zoom 100%, show edit toolbar
- halbrunder Pfeil für Vertauschungen
- rounded rect
        //painter.setPen(QPen(Qt::darkGreen, 3, Qt::DotLine, Qt::RoundCap, Qt::RoundJoin));
        //painter.drawRoundRect(100, 200, 100, 200, 10, 10);

LATER
-----
- add "Treat as new" to the file menu (scenario: opened via command line but want to save to the default location)
- Include build information in excecutable (or data file)
    - application version
        - version.h
            - local-build oder ähnlich
    - Architecture
    - hostname of build machine
- package: provide desktop file with app icon
- remove all remaining catch blocks
    - see: ScopeGuard, see http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/C-and-Beyond-2012-Andrei-Alexandrescu-Systematic-Error-Handling-in-C
- selection handles
    - Ctrl for proportional
    - see also qDebug() << "...handle was just clicked without moving... TODO: toggle proportional mode";
- enable hover visual
    - mouse over: draw a light version of the selection rects
    - maybe: make sure line has a bigger catch area when trying to move
- Obfuscate:
    - ggf. nochmal probieren: jedes Bild upToAnItem einzeln rendern und das dann jeweils als baseImage verwenden
- select no tool => zoom to fit
- New file => create new filename instead of keeping the old one
- BUG:
    - Select Tool selected
    - with mouse over an item ("move" cursor is shown)
    - Hit ESC => "move" cursor switches to normal and one has to move mouse to restore it
- new: KreenColorButton with transparency handling etc
- crop img op and SelectionHandles
    - see see MainEditorWidget::slotFixSelectableAndMovable(): // TODO: "false, true" to fix visiblity of selection handles is not very nice. Find out a better way.
- // TODO: make  a simple example to find the cause (maybe because we use MainEditorWidget
    - to find bug: cursors sticks to be the resize cursor when resizing main window
- cmake for testdata: file(COPY yourDir DESTINATION yourDestination)
- cmake fix warning:
      Policy CMP0028 is not set: Double colon in target name means ALIAS or ...
- PageOutput Settings: file format combobox should use setModel(), QAbstractItemModel,
    be an own widget and show also description
- OpenSuseBuild service
    - pak: run unit tests after build
- Ctrl+Shift+C: copy image to clipboard
    - show message flash, when done (or KMessageBox, "show never again")
    - plus: provide drag source for DND
- Open last save location
- header file handling
    see: add_dependencies(kreenshot-editor prepare-include-files) / prepare-include-files.sh
    remove the script completely with a better solution
- lib: provide different kinds of mainwidget
   - with or without toolbar
   - with some predefined stuff etc.
- Select a Item
  - Controls for common properties appear
     - most recently used or pinned colors
     - slider for line width
     - slider for font size
     - slider for arrow tip typ?
- AFTER UndoManager is complete:
    - write filename in title and full path in status bar (<path> [change...])
        let appear in windows title and in filename --> statusbar / ...edit pattern...
        [NEW] ...
        *  ... (see mainwindow.cpp)
- "Open last file storage location" or "Open storage location"
- see // TODO: make  a simple example to find the cause (maybe because we use MainEditorWidget
    - wegen KreenGraphicsView::enterEvent
- Drag source for image in toolbar
    - this can currently been achieved by lauching default viewer (Ctrl+Alt+L) and use drag source from there
- DND:
    - Drop image on scene to create an image object not implemented yet.\nDrop the image anywhere else on the window to load it as new base image.
    - better: not not distinguish between window and scene => maybe show a context menu or similar
- DND: support dropping images from HTTP browser
    // TODO: support also http images
- "Copy filename to clipboard": show notification that something was copied; show warning if file is not saved yet
- how to read/use the scalable image (svg)?
     //baseImage = QIcon::fromTheme("kcmkwm").pixmap(QSize(512, 512)).toImage();
- ? do not ask to save document if default image is loaded and document is clean
- ? load default image from a resource
- ? click on empty space should choose Select tool
- ? use m4 to generate settings class
- ? SelectionHandles
    - change cursor to cross when resizing
